About Golf
</summary>
<div>
Golf is a game that many people play, but few are good at it. You hit a small white ball with a metal club 
until the small white ball goes in a small hole over 100 yards away.

What it Buzkashi?
</summary>
<div>
Buzkashi or "Goat Pulling" is a traditional Afghan game where there are two teams on horseback each fighting 
to throw a dead goat into a raised hole. The team with the most points wins. You may ask, 
"why a dead goat? It's 2020." To that I say, "why not?".

Origins
</summary>
<div>
The game was created when waring tribes would steal eachother's goats on horseback, then they would 
chase the goat stealer. After they'd done it enough times it became fun, so they made a game out of it.

About Shin Kicking
</summary>
<div>
You may not think shin kicking is a hobby but I assure you it is. It consists of two grown men with hay 
stuffed up thier pants wailing at eachother's shins in order to force the the other to the ground.
The sport has yearly world championships that are attended by hundreds of people.

My hobbies are all of the sports/competition genre, but thats just because I am a competitive person 
and enjoy winning too much to leave it to only one method of competition. A couple of them are a little 
unorthodox, but they bring me joy and that's all that mattters ;)
